        "99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: <br/><br/><p align="center">99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.<br/>Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.</p><br/><br/>The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero./nYour task here is write a Python program capable of generating all the verses of the song.db"
